                In the essay, Carr talks about how technology prevents our brains from developing. Carr argues that the internet makes things too easy for everyone, and that people aren't utilizing their brains in productive ways. He explains how individuals can no longer
                concentrate long enough to read a book and instead seek for "quick wins" while browsing online titles. He also states that the Internet violates our privacy and that corporations like Google collect information about us. To Carr, technology
                is not everything for humans and it is altering our brain activity, restricting our ability to think independently, and invading people's privacy.
